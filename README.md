# Largest-SCC-in-Big-Data
This project has the c++ code to compute the size of Strongly Connected Component SCC in a given directed graph. A strongly connected component is a partition of a directed graph in which there is a path from each vertex to another vertex in the partition. This is applied only on Directed graphs.
